Database for E-commerce website using MySQL

I have successfully designed and implemented a MySQL database for an E-commerce website, featuring various tables with essential columns to support seamless functionality. The database includes tables for customers, sellers, coupons, wishlists, reviews, orders, product categories, payment details, shipment information, products, sale status, and questions and answers with sellers. I have diligently populated these tables with sample data, ensuring a fully functional and immersive user experience. With this robust database in place, the E-commerce website is now equipped to handle a diverse range of operations, enabling smooth interactions between customers, sellers, and products.
